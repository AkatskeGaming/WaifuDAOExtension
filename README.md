# WaifuDAOExtension
This is a Chrome extension that is mainly aimed at providing an automatic Rarity calculator for Digital Eyes Marketplace.

This extension is both a rarity calculator and a rarity overlay for the DigitalEyes WAIFU DAO GAMING GUILD Marketplace.

Simply browse listings with the extension enabled and the rarity of each listed waifu will be automatically added to the listings on screen.

You can also click on the extension icon to bring up the rarity calculator to calculate the rarity of any Waifu trait combination you want.

How To Use: In order to test the extension from this project first download the zip. Then go to the manage extensions tab in Google Chrome and enable developer mode. Click on the "Load Unpacked" button and select the "WaifuDAOExtension" folder (the folder that contains the scripts). Once the extension has been added to chrome it will automatically work in the background and will attempt to parse the rarites of any listed waifus once the script detects that the user is on the "https://digitaleyes.market/collections/Waifu%20DAO%20Gaming%20Guild" url.

Future Features: Currently calculating rarities of owned Waifus in the Digital Eyes Sell tab is not supported because the data is retrieved from a different api, it will be easier to implement once all waifus have been minted.
